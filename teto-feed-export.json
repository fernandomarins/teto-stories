I’m already starting to miss payments on a loan I took out recently.  I made two cold calls today and both of them went like shit.  I’d never do anything bad to get money, but who knows.  I’m beginning to dread going home.  My kids are small and want …to be with me all the time, but I’m so stressed that I have no patience.  I’ve been losing my temper easily.  We were at my brother-in-law’s house this weekend, and he’s doing much better than I am.  His kids have a bunch of toys.  My son kept begging me to buy the same stupid little toy truck that his cousin had.  And I yelled at him to forget it.  I only had enough money in my pocket to get us home.”",

I scheduled all our classes together.  I always wanted to know where she was.  It all started a year ago when she cheated on me.  She called me immediately afterwards and confessed.  But ever since then, anytime she’s away from me, I always imagine the worst.  She goes out with friends and some of them are male.  So it’s hard for me to not get suspicious.  And if I get suspicious, she gets nervous.  Which makes me even more suspicious.”",
